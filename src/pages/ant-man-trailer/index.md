So for this analysis to work as intended, there are a few key points I want to touch upon before 
I can start explaining the trailer.

**Ant Man Origins -**

The trailer doesn’t really tell us the origin of Ant Man. I don’t want to sit here and preach about 
his whole origin story, because neither you nor I have the time to do that. 
So, I will quickly explain what’s what in the “tiny” world of Ant Man.

In the trailer we are introduced to two individuals as the main good guys. 
One of them is introduced as Hank Pym, the other as Scott Lang. Both of these characters are at one 
point in their life Ant Man. Never at the same time. 
So the trailer suggests that Hank has already been the Ant man (if we follow the comic book example) 
and Scott is about to become the second. This is more or less correct.

The trailer, however, then goes on to suggest the Ant Man suit wasn’t created by Hank Pym but by an 
evil character. The evil guy’s name is not mentioned in the trailer, however it’s pretty much stated 
by Marvel who the bad guy is.

So, with these smaller facts put together from the comics and the movie, 
I want to go ahead and say let’s forget all of this for now and start with how Ant Man came to be.

In the 1960s, the character Hank Pym was created and introduced the small but already complex 
Marvel universe. Hank Pym - or Henry as was his real name (but for consistency we’ll keep with Hank) - 
was an American biochemist and scientific genius with expertise in a wide range of fields from 
quantum physics to cybernetics. He then invented (or discovered, there is disagreement on this), 
the special subatomic “Pym Particles.” The Pym Particles are particles that can change matter to either 
grow or shrink in size. It was originally used to shrink, hence where Ant Man comes from. 
He invented a helmet that made him able to control or communicate with ants.

So that’s the short version of how and what Ant Man is.

So let’s move onto the second Ant Man, Scott Lang. Scott works as an electronics expert who turns 
his talents to burglary when he can no longer support his family. It wasn’t long before he was caught 
and sent to prison, but he was released after 3 years for good behaviour. 
During his time in prison, Scott’s wife divorced him. He then spent his time mastering electronics 
further and soon after his release was hired by Stark Industries. When Scott learns that his 
daughter has a congenital heart condition, he seeks the help of Dr. Erica Sondheim. 
Desperately in need of money to pay for her help, he returns to thievery.

From his job at Stark Industries, he learns that Pym Industries have some insane technology, 
so Scott decides to pay them a not-so-formal visit. Scott breaks into the home of Hank Pym instead of 
the laboratory. In Hank’s home, Scott finds the Ant Man suit and steals it. 
Hank sees Scott stealing the suit, but lets him. Hank then disguises himself as his counter alias, 
Yellowjacket, and follows Scott to observe him and see what he can do with the Ant Man suit.

Scott uses his newly stolen suit to break into another laboratory, the Cross laboratory. 
While breaking in, Scott discovers that Darren Cross – the owner of the Cross company - was keeping 
Dr. Erica Sondheim captive to cure his own heart disease. Scott fights Crossfire (Cross’s villain name) 
and rescues Erica who cures his daughter. Scott decides to return the Ant Man suit to Hank, 
but he tells Scott to keep it as long as he uses it for lawful purposes.

Phew! That’s a lot of text we’ve just been through! You still with us? Good, lets keep going.

**Ant Man trailer analysis -**

In the beginning of the trailer we are introduced to the “Super Suit” or the Ant Man suit. 
It is revealed as a suit that grants its wearer with powers to become  as small as an insect but still 
remain strong. Hank Pym realises that if everyone had access to these “godlike” powers there would 
be chaos. While this is rolling we have some action scenes going on.

Hank talks to a woman - highly plausible to be the Wasp - whose real name is “Hope Van Dyne (Pym)”, 
Scott’s wife. Hope asks, “So how do we stop him,” to which Hank replies, “I know a guy.”

Scott Lang is introduced during a semi “montage” of Scott. I won’t repeat exactly what’s being said as 
I believe the trailer explains it pretty well by itself. Scott gets introduced to the Ant Man suit, 
where he gets told by Hope that it has powers and now it is his job to learn how to control them.

We then meet our villain, Yellowjacket , aka Hank Pym. However, this is not Hank Pym. 
There is another impersonating Yellowjacket.. My guess is that Marvel took a choice and made 
Yellowjacket a villain instead of being an alias of Hank Pym, considering that Scott Lang is the 
Ant Man and not Hank. There’s a lot of action featured in the trailer, which has really hyped up 
its audience in how awesome and action-packed this movie is going to be.

In the end of the trailer there is a scene I think is worth watching again and again and 
I cannot wait to see it on the big screen!!
